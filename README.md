The **TM1637** is an IC commonly used in Arduino seven-segment display modules. This project provides a library for these modules that abstracts away the low-level communication protocol and operation codes required to interface with the IC. By adding the library to their sketch, users can easily display numbers, time, and temperature on their displays.
